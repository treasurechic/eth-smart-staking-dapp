# Simple Smart Staking Wallet Dapp

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 

It demonstrates a staking wallet that lets users deposit ETH into a staking pool that earns users WEB3(an ERC20 token) over time. The user can withdraw from the staking pool at anytime. Each second, the user earns 1% WEB3 tokens so the longer the user stays in the pool, the more WEB3 someone earns. Anytime the user stakes additional ETH into the pool or unstakes from the staking pool using the same wallet, the appropriate amount of WEB3s is rewarded to the user. The same user can generate infinite amount of wallets.
